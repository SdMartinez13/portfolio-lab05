      "description": "My name is Stephen Martinez.  Before my journey here at Codefellows, I was in the security industry.  Most recently I worked for a school district where I was a safety and security officer as well as a high school baseball and wrestling coach.  I was injured on the job and it got me thinking of what I could do while I was at home healing.  A family member told me I should look into what he does, which is software development.  I was very interested and when he showed me what he does and what he creates, I was hooked.  Ideally, I'd like to work in an environment where I'm helping people with my new skills I'm learning.  I think my drive to help the people around me and my work ethic will set me in the right direction in my goals to becoming a successful Developer.",
